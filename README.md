# RDA5807m-Module-
A small eagle library for popular RDA5807m Radio module that one can buy on many Chinese shopping sites in the size a a small PCB.
It was always a problem with connecting it to Arduino or any other MC for prototyping. When creating a small breakout board with 3.3V
regulator, stereo jack and antenna connector I also had to create an Eagle library for PCB design. Maybe it will be usefull to you.
